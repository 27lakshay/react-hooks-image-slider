# React Hooks Image Slider

A React Hooks rebuild of the previous slider, which utilized class based components & redux. No matter how many slides are put into the slider as props, we only render three slides at a time, which dramatically reduces the amount of logic/math that we need to do. Simple.

## Use

- `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/react-hooks-image-slider.git`
- `cd react-hooks-image-slider`
- `git checkout autoplay`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
