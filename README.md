# React Hooks Image Slider

A React Hooks rebuild of the previous slider, which utilized class based components & redux. No matter how many slides are put into the slider as props, we only render three slides at a time, which dramatically reduces the amount of logic/math that we need to do. Simple.

I put very large images in at full screen in the demo for dramatic effect.

## Use

## Medium Article & YouTube Videos

If you are here from Medium or YouTube, I've separated each part into different branches, so you can view/run the code from that point in time.

- [Part 1](https://github.com/DZuz14/react-hooks-image-slider/tree/part-1)
- [Part 2: Autoplay](https://github.com/DZuz14/react-hooks-image-slider/tree/part-2)
- Part 3. There is no part 3 branch, the master branch is what we end up with at the end of the series.
